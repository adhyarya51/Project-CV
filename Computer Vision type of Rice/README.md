Problem Statement
Develop a computer vision model for rice classification and image prediction.

Background
Rice is a staple food for a significant portion of the global population, particularly in Asia, where it forms the dietary cornerstone for the majority of people, especially in middle and lower socioeconomic classes. Asia produces approximately 90% of the world's rice, predominantly through small-scale farmers.

Rice is not a monolithic crop; it exists in numerous varieties, each influenced by the climate of the region where it is grown. Recognizing and classifying these varieties is essential for agricultural practices, trade, and consumption. This project aims to leverage computer vision and deep learning to classify rice into five distinct types: Karacadag, Ipsala, Jasmine, Arborio, and Basmati.

The objective is to create a robust model capable of accurately identifying and classifying these five types of rice, followed by deploying the model for practical use in identifying rice varieties from images.

### Project Output

The project aims to develop a machine learning model for computer vision to classify different rice types. Uploading images to the model will accurately identify the rice variety. This involves collecting and preprocessing image data, training a classification model, and validating its performance to ensure accuracy of around 98% and reliable identification of rice types.
