Topical Issues:

Conducts an economic analysis of country indices using four key categories.
Description:

Economic freedom is a fundamental right that allows individuals to control their employment and property. In a society with economic freedom, individuals are free to choose their work, production, consumption, and investments. This environment encourages governments to create jobs, facilitate the free movement of capital, and allow industries to operate freely. However, global economic conditions fluctuate annually, and 2024 is particularly shaped by conflicts and political tensions between countries. According to the Heritage Foundation (2023), economic freedom is measured by four categories: rule of law, government size, regulatory efficiency, and open markets. My analysis will focus on Indonesia, examining its economic condition in 2024 through these categories to understand the broader implications for the country's economic freedom.

**Methods: SMART Analysis

Specific: The research will focus on analyzing country index data to assess economic freedom, concentrating on specific categories of measurement.

Measurable: The analysis will evaluate economic freedom using four key indicators: rule of law, government size, regulatory efficiency, and open markets. A specific country will be used as an example to illustrate the measurement process.

Achievable: The analysis aims to identify economic conditions through these four categories, providing clear insights that can address the issues identified.

Relevant: Understanding each country's economic situation is crucial for policymakers, academics, journalists, business leaders, and investors. This analysis offers foundational insights for economic development and decision-making.

Time-Bound: The analysis will be completed within a set timeframe, providing timely and valuable insights for policymakers to inform their decision-making processes.

SMART Summary: The economic index analysis utilizes four key measurements to guide decision-making for companies and other stakeholders.

**SMART** : Analisis indeks ekonomi menggunakan empat pengukuran guna menentukan pengambilan keputusan kepada pihak perusahaan.

 Pengukuran kebebasan ekonomi memiliki empat kategori yaitu : 

    - Rule of law (property right, government integrity, judicial effectiveness) "average"

    - Government Size (government spending, tax burden, fiscal health) "average"

    - Regulatory Efficiency (business freedom, labor freedom, monetary freedom) "average"

    - Open Markets (trade freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom) "average"

The analysis will include:

Ranking the top 5 countries based on their overall economic freedom scores.
Identifying the 5 countries with the lowest scores.
Determining which region has the highest average score.
Measuring the rule of law for each country.
Measuring government size for each country.
Measuring regulatory efficiency for each country.
Measuring open markets for each country.
Analyzing the economic freedom of ASEAN countries specifically.
