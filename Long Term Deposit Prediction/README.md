Objective
Deploy supervised learning models to predict customer behavior patterns for targeted marketing campaigns.

Problem Statement
The goal is to predict whether a prospective customer will subscribe to a deposit product based on phone call interactions. Accurate prediction will aid in the formulation of effective marketing strategies by identifying patterns in customer behavior.

Background
The data provided comes from a Portuguese bank institution. The marketing team aims to develop a predictive model to assess the likelihood of a prospective customer subscribing to a deposit account after being contacted by phone. The objective is to use machine learning techniques to analyze customer data patterns and inform the teamâ€™s marketing strategies. The data includes various variables that will be examined to determine the best approach for predicting customer responses.

###  Project Ouput 

The project aims to develop a supervised machine learning model using bank data to predict potential customers for long-term deposits. By having 84% accuracy in identifying these customers, the model will help optimize the efforts of frontline callers, reducing the need to contact the same individuals and enhancing overall efficiency repeatedly.
Technology / Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Tableu, Kaggle, SVC, Catboost, grid, pipeline, phik, seaborn, matplotlib.
